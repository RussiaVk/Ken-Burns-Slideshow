How nice would it be if we can create instant slideshows on a Windows machine with only a single executable and a folder of images.\r\n## Screenshot\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8\" src=\"http://carlchang.blog.com/files/2015/12/无标题.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"366\" />\r\n## Language &amp; Requirement\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>WPF application written in VB.net</li>\r\n\t<li>.Net framework 4.5 or above.</li>\r\n\t<li>Config.xml file at application root.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n## Features\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Create instant full-screen slideshow with an imitation of the Ken Burns effect for a set of folders that contains images. Images will be looped.</li>\r\n\t<li>Support displaying date for the images. Date value is parsed from the file name with format <em>yyyy-MM-dd</em>. Please rename the image files to the format for this to work. A valid example: <em>2015-12-02.jpg</em></li>\r\n\t<li>Support audio files to be played in loop at background. Please specify a folder path containing audio files in config.xml.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n## Note\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The config.xml file serves as a configuration that is loaded at program start. Paths need to be changed to local / relative path according to the location of the folders on your system.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
